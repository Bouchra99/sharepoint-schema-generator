## üóÇÔ∏è SharePoint Schema Generator
This project is a Python console application that connects to Microsoft Graph API to fetch SharePoint lists and columns and automatically generates a UML-Like diagram of the data schema.

It was inspired by a real-world challenge when building a PowerApps application with SharePoint as a database, making it easier to visualize list relationships and improve documentation.

* Detects lookup columns and builds relationship diagrams.
* Generates a UML diagram in PNG format.
